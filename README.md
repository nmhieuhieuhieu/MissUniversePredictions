# MissUniversePredictions
MISS UNIVERSE PREDICTIONS is a beauty queen fanpage, which provides daily news and updates about Miss Universe. The website is a place to predict and discuss their chances of winning based on many factors such as beauty, talent and social influence of Miss Universe World. MISS UNIVERSE PREDICTIONS becomes the premier destination for enthusiasts and followers of the event worldwide. The data collected over time creates a comprehensive view of how users interact with the content shared on the site. With the research goal of analyzing interaction, popular content and the relationship between interaction and content, I have applied a series of data analysis and data visualization methods to present results. Profound and meaningful conclusions about the activities of that Facebook page.
