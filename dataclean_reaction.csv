There seems to be an imbalance in various aspects for each candidate. Miss Universe looks for women who can articulate and serve as role models for women worldwide.

"The ""Goddess of Ayothaya"" costume draws inspiration from the graven image, ""Phra Mae Thorani"", during the late Ayothaya Dynasties of Siamese Kingdom existed during 14th to 18th century.

""Phra Mae Thorani"", the goddess of Earth or the Mother Nature in Buddhist Mythology is highly revered and worshipped throughout the Thai history. “Phra Mae Thorani” is usually depicted as a beautiful deity twisting her long hair tail producing the holy water, which eventually nourishes humankind with the water abundance. As “Thorani” means earth or land, it is believed that she resides in the land where she blesses humanity with fertility and abundance of nature. She symbolizes the significance of nature to human and embodies the protection of land and its richness of prosperity where Thai people hold dearly to their hearts.

The dressing and accessories were constructed to resemble the graven image from Ayothaya Kingdom. The jewelry combines wirework with the use of colored stones and precious gems to align with actual recorded geological data from the period.

And this is the pride of Nation, the symbol of richness in both culture and nature, the Goddess of Ayothaya.
